% Discrete Curvature Approximation
\section{Discrete Curvature Approximation}
The concept of ``deviation'' as defined above is relatively 
straightforward and intuitive. However, another related way of describing 
``how well'' a \textit{discretization} represents a \textit{curve} is the 
degree to which the discrete representation approximates curvature -- 
where curvature is defined as the amount of ``bend'' in a \textit{curve} 
or surface, or ``how much'' a \textit{curve} or surface ``differs'' from a 
straight line or plane (words in quotes are subject to gradation). First, 
however, curvature must be defined in such a way that a discrete 
approximation is meaningful and appropriate. In relevant literature there 
are many ways to estimate curvature \cite{hermann07}. Some of it bears 
repeating, because it is germane to what is being discussed here: Consider 
the following planar \textit{curve}, C, at point P. At a given point P 
there exists an osculating circle, O, of radius r such that the circle has 
the same tangent as the \textit{curve} C as well as the same radius of 
curvature \cite{gray97}.

\end{figure}

\noindent Just as the tangent line is the line best approximating a \textit{curve} at a point, the osculating circle is the best circle that approximates the \textit{curve} a point. Ignoring degenerate \textit{curve}s such as straight lines, the osculating circle of a given \textit{curve} at a given point is unique \cite{gray97}. The radius, r, of the osculating circle at a given point on a \textit{curve} is equal to the radius of curvature, R, which is the reciprocal of curvature, $\kappa$--sometimes called the ``first curvature'' \cite{kreyszig91}. For a two-dimensional \textit{curve} of the form $y=f(x)$, the equation for curvature is:
\[ 
R=\frac{1}{\kappa} \textnormal{, where } 
\kappa=\frac{\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}{[1+\frac{dy}{dx}^2 ]^\frac{3}{2}}. 
\]
\noindent This quantity, $\kappa$, necessarily includes the calculation of 
derivatives which, depending on the representation of the underlying geometrical description, could be relatively costly. Therefore, this is avoided by defining this radius of curvature on a segment or at a point in the \textit{discretization} without the use of derivatives. This is discussed in the following paragraphs.

A value of curvature can be calculated for each edge in the \textit{discretization} by considering the corresponding osculating circle on a given edge. The osculating circle here (circle, \Cref{fig:OsculatingCircle}) can be approximated by considering the circumscribed circle (circumcircle) \cite{casey1888} defined by the two end points of the edge, $P_0$ and $P_1$, and a point, P, between them in the \textit{curve} parameterization (\Cref{fig:CircumscribedCircle}) -- the radius of the circumcircle will be referred to as the discrete radius of curvature.

Consider a circular segment, which represents the \textit{curve} $s$.  The corresponding chord, which represents a segment in the \textit{discretization}--$a$, and saggitta--which represents the ``deviation'' of the segment away from the \textit{curve} $h$ is shown in \Cref{fig:CircleGeometry}.

\end{figure}.

\begin{theorem}
As the length of $a$ approaches the length of $s$, the length of $h$ goes 
to zero, therefore the radius of the circle, $R$, goes to infinity.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{lcl}
a & = & 2*\sqrt{R^2-r^2}=2*\sqrt{(h*(2*R-h)}.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
Upon rearranging, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{lcl}
R & = & \frac{(\frac{a}{2})^2*\frac{1}{h}+h}{2}=
\frac{a^2+4*h^2}{8*h}=\frac{a^2}{8*h}+\frac{h}{2}.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
Finally,
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\lim_{h\to0} (\frac{a^2}{(8*h)}+\frac{h}{2}) & = & \infty.
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{proof}

Given the aforementioned proof, if the discrete curvature radius is 
divided by the length of the corresponding segment on the \textit{curve}, then itâ€™s value approaches zero. This is a scale-independent measure that converges to a computer representable number as the \textit{discretization} approaches the length of the \textit{curve}. The parameter is known as the curvature ratio. It is an intuitive measure that relates ``how far'' the \textit{curve} deviates from the segment that is representing it as the ratio of those lengths. Consider a point on a \textit{curve} between two endpoints of a segment of a \textit{discretization}, as seen in \Cref{ref:CurvatureRatio}. The length of the segment, $L_i$, is the distance from $P_0$ to $P_1$. The perpendicular distance between the point on the \textit{curve} between the end points and the segment is $L_c$. The three points define a curvature ratio through the ratio of $L_c$ to $L_i$.

\frac{L_c}{L_i}$

\noindent As shown in \cite{mclaurin12}, deviation-based methods are 
intuitive and straightforward to implement. However, drawbacks include the fundamental lack of consistently being able to indicate discretization accuracy for curves that are not ``well-behaved'' between discrete segments.
