% Error Bounds
\section{Error Bounds}
Since the optimization function for each curve is not given access to derivative information, it is conceivable that it would not find the optimal value and instead converge to a local minimum.  However, the problem of escaping local minima is common to all optimization problems.  The addition of the conditional that states: ``refine a segment if the refinement changes the length of the entire discretization by more than an epsilon'' was deliberately included to lessen the chance that a segment would not be refined when it was prudent to do so.  If the method succeeds in finding the global minimum for each segment, then the error bound will be on the order of the segment length.  However, when the method fails to do so, or chooses a local minimum instead, there is no formal way to express the error as a function of arc-length-deficit--since there is no information about what the global minimum might be (without explicitly calculating the length of the curve/segment).  Therefore, the error can only be quantified for when the method has succeeded in finding the minimum for each segment.

Arc-length-deficit is a single-value function on the curve.  The obvious problem with this single-valued function is that the actual arc-length of the curve is never known and can therefore not be compared to the arc-length of the segments.  How then can error be quantified? The error bounds could be detailed for unimodal pieces of the curve--those where the ALD function has one peak.  However, for segments that do not have a unimodal distribution of the ALD function on the local curve segment, the error estimation is not straightforward.  In fact, it is no longer possible to determine what the bound for the arc-length-deficit error is.  However, we can state some observations about the geometry related to these configurations:

Assume that the optimization function on a general segment found the global minimum, i.e. maximized the change in edge-length for the new combined segments, for the segment and corresponding curve piece.  With the given geometry, an ellipsoid can be formed with the endpoints of the segment, $F_1$ and $F_2$, as the foci and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are defined implicitly by the new segments connecting the new point with the endpoints of the current segment, $r_1$ and $r_2$.  ``An ellipse is a curve that is the locus of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances $r_1$ and $r_2$ from two fixed points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (the foci) separated by a distance of $2c$ is a given positive constant $2a$'' \cite{weissteine}.  With the above assumption and definition, the entirety of the curve represented by the segment must lie within the prolate spheroid  formed by the geometry below in Figure-\ref{EllipseGeometry}.

Proof: If the perimeter is maximized keeping $2c$ a constant, $(r_1 + r_2)$ is maximized \textit{because} $2c$ is a constant.  Maximizing $(r_1+r_2)$ maximizes a from the following relation with $2c$ being constant: $r_1 + r_2 = 2a$.  Combining the following relation, $b^2 = a^2 + c^2$, with the area of the ellipse, $A = \pi * a * b$, yields $A=\pi^{2}*a^{2}(a^{2} - c^2)$.  If $c$ is a constant and $a$ is maximized, then the maximal area is obtained from maximal $(r_1+r_2)$.  Which means the curve must be inside of the spheroid defined by the ellipse.  If the curve is not inside the spheroid then there is a point on the curve such that $(r_1+r_2)$ is larger and therefore the area is larger and therefore the volume is larger which means that $(r_1+r_2)$ was not maximized.

Observe that there was no mention of the length of the curve inside of the spheroid, or the ruled area that the segment and curve could define.  This is because there is no way this information can be known (without explicitly calculating the length of the curve/segment).  It is unfortunate that there is no way to quantify the discretization error of a curve except in terms of volume of the spheroids defined by each segment.  This is non-intuitive, but no more specificity is possible.  The volumes would also be scale-dependent and offer no insight into how well the discretization approximates the curve -- without some context.
